# moduleaddon

Those are modules I've made that work through World of Warcraft's UI to change it's appearance to a more pleasant and customizable way.
The options are toggles, so the user can match different options to make his own UI look unique to his style.
In order to implement the modules in-game and make a menu to toggle them, you need to write the folders name (moduleaddon) through the library inside your own addon folder, XML is necessary aswell if you want to save variables.
